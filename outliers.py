# When analysing data collected as part of a science experiment it may be desirable to remove the most extreme values
# before performing other calculations. Write a function that takes a list of values and an non-negative integer, n, as
# its parameters. The function should create a new copy of the list with the n largest elements and the n smallest
# elements removed. Then it should return the new copy of the list as the functionâ€™s only result. The order of the
# elements in the returned list does not have to match the order of the elements in the original list. Write a main
# program that demonstrates your function. Your function should read a list of numbers from the user and remove the two
# largest and two smallest values from it. Display the list with the outliers removed, followed by the original list.
# Your program should generate an appropriate error message if the user enters less than 4 values.
